You have already built the basic student management system in class with:
Add Student


Delete Student


Update Student


Display One Student


Display All Students


Now extend the system with the following new features.
1. Search Student by Name
Function: search_student_by_name()


Ask the user for a name.


Print the details of all students with that name.


2. Count Students
Function: count_students()


Show the total number of students in the system.
3. Filter by Age
Function: filter_by_age()


Ask the user to enter an age.


Show only students older than that age.

e.g 

Enter Your choice: 8

Enter Minimum Age: 21

ID: 2, Name: Alice, Age: 22

ID: 3, Name: Bob, Age: 25
